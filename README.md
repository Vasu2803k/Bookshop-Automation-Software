# Bookshop-Automation-Software


Introduction:

   The Bookshop Automation Software (BAS) is to automate all operations in a bookshop.
Generally it includes the Order Processing, Stock Management and Accounts Management. Also
BAS will provide the ability to search any book using the book title or the name of the author
that are available in the shop and in case where the book is not available in the stock, it will ask
the customer to enter full details of the book for procurement of the book in future and
increment a request field for the book.
BAS will help the manager to periodically view the request field of the books so as to arrive at a
rough estimate regarding the current demand for different books. Also it maintains the price of
various books.

--> BAS should help the customer query whether a book is in stock. 
--> The user can query the availability of a book either by using the book title or by using
the name of the author. 
--> If the book is not currently being sold by book-shop, then the customer is asked to enter
full details of the book for procurement of the book in future. 
--> If a book is in stock, the exact number of copies available and rack number in which the
book is located should be displayed. 
--> If a book is not in stock, the query for book is used to increment are quest field for the
book. 
--> The manager can periodically view the request field of the books to arrive at a rough
estimate regarding the current demand for different books.BAS should maintain the
price of various books.
--> As soon as a customer selects a book for purchase, the sales clerk would enter the
ISBN number of book. BAS should update the stock and generate the sales receipt for
the book.BAS should allow sales statistics (viz., book name, publisher, ISBN Number,
Number of copies sold and sales revenue) for any period. 
--> The sales statistics will help the owner to know the exact business done over any period
of time& also to determine inventory level required for various books.
--> The inventory level required for a book is equals to number of copies of book sold over a
period of two weeks multiplied by average number of days it takes to procure the book
from its publisher. 
--> Every day the book shop owner would give a command for the BAS to print the books
which have fallen below the threshold
